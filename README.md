# Razer-Core-Case
 [Solidworks] 3D model for customizing a Razer Core X case.
 
### Introduction
* Razer core X is all good, except one thing: It is so freakin heavy.
* I want a good eGPU that I can take around with me, so I decided to model the exterior of Razer Core X and then add a bunch of honeycomb holes, finally print it out using PLA plastic so it will be much lighter then the original enclosure.
