# Razer-Core-Case
### Introduction
* Razer core X is all good, except one thing: It is so freakin heavy (6.48 kg / 14.29 lbs without GPU I mean WTF).
* I want a good eGPU that I can take around with me, so I decided to model the exterior of Razer Core X and then add a bunch of honeycomb holes, finally print it out using PLA plastic so it will be much lighter then the original enclosure.
* Also can be used for other TB3 eGPU boards in the future...It's a good case design.
