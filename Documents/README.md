### Documents
* Contains the files I got for reference.
* The R3G TB3 DWG is from the manufacturer, and therefore is not open to the public.
  * Thanks R3G for providing their drawing!
  * If you are interested in the dimensions you should check out my SolidWorks model.
  * It is encrypted with a password that is 21 letters long with upper and lower case and special characters, so don't attempt to break it.
